## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to use more specifically, Display grid integrated with display flex in some moments
I don't using anyone framework JS because I don't think was necessary but I will make this card in Angular
for Modularize.

### Continued development

I don't use yet but probably I will use Vercel or Netlify to make deployment to the card.
